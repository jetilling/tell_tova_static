          First things first, you have no money. Let's just clear that up right now. And chances are you won't have any money until you
          find yourself pricing out Buick Lacrosse's. So, take a couple minutes to drill this in your head: I have no money. I have no money.
          I have no money. I have no money. The more you say it the more you start to feel that it's true. This is good!

          At this point it might be a good idea to set a reminder in your phone. Here are a couple reminder suggestions: "I have no money",
          "What if I lose my job?", "How will I make this month work?", "Are you sure you've paid every thing?". It's best to have this
          reminder run every day at around 10pm, as I've found this to be the best time to think about your financial situation. Actually,
          studies have shown that in the morning the brain is more logic based and does best working on simple, clear problems. As the day
          goes on our brain becomes more creative and expressive. So the end of the day is logically the best time to contemplate your horrid
          financial condition.
